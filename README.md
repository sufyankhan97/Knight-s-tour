# Knight's Tour

## Description
This git repository holds the files required for the ECE551 course Fall 2021 project. The project involves flashing verilog code on to an FPGA unit to
successfully complete a knight's tour on a 5X5 chess board when starting from any black sqaure (knight's tour can only be completed from black squares on 
chess boards with odd number of sqaures per side).

## File Structure
The top level folders exisiting in this repo and the files therein can be understood pretty easily by looking at the names of these folders. All files 
required for the project should be uploaded to the [ProjectFiles](https://github.com/sufyankhan97/Knight-s-tour/tree/main/ProjectFiles) directory. Please
ensure proper commenting of the files, both for yourself and for the next person who might want to take a look. 

## Deadlines
Deadlines to note for project submission are:
1. .zip file of design due by midnight 10th December (not sure if this is still valid)
2. Project demo from 10/12 to 16/10 - we should target the 10th (3% extra credit) and definitely be done before 15/12 (last date before penalty)
